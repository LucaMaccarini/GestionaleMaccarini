# GestionaleMaccarini
# Description
This repository contains the project I submitted for my High School Final Exam

A management system to support existing archives and streamline the tracking of file locations, reducing unnecessary time waste.

## Configuration:

- Use the dedicated registration page to register all users who need access to the archives.
- Once all users are registered, press the 'lock' button on the registration page to prevent further registrations. This will block any attempt to create a new account.
- To re-enable registration, follow the instructions in the 'unlock registration.txt' file located in the '/login' directory.
